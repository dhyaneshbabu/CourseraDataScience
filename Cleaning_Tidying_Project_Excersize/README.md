## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, 
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used
for later analysis.


This is the  project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity and feature info
3. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which
   reflect a mean or standard deviation
4. Merge the training and test data
5. Converts the `activity` into factors
6. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The result is stored in the file `tidy_data.txt`.
