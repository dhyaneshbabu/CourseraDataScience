| The first column represents each of five possible grades that students could receive for a particular class. The second and third columns give the number
| of male and female students, respectively, that received each grade.

| This dataset actually has three variables: grade, sex, and count. The first variable, grade, is already a column, so that should remain as it is. The
| second variable, sex, is captured by the second and third column headings. The third variable, count, is the number of students for each combination of
| grade and sex.

| To tidy the students data, we need to have one column for each of these three variables. We'll use the gather() function from tidyr to accomplish this.
| Pull up the documentation for this function with ?gather.
